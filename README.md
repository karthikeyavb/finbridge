# 🌐 FinBridge

FinBridge is a modern, responsive web application built to promote **financial literacy** and **digital financial awareness** — particularly for underserved users and young learners. It is inspired by JPMorgan Chase’s mission to use technology for social good, and it was created as part of my application initiative toward the **Code for Good Hackathon**.

## 📣 Why This Project?

> I wasn’t selected for the Code for Good hackathon, but I believe in the cause and wanted to contribute.

This is a **work-in-progress** and I welcome feedback, collaboration, or suggestions from mentors, developers, or JPMC representatives.
